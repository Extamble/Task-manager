# Task-manager

It's my first application written in HTML, CSS and JS.
This is extended version of typical ToDoList application. 
You can add tasks, remove them, set the deadline time, creation time and state.
If you don't set the creation time it will generate automaticly.
When the task is created, you can edit it by clicking on it.
Application has the task counter which describe number of current tasks.
You can also seach task by their name.
